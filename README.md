## Thoughts and Process
Almost everyone knows about **STREAMLIT**, which is a simple way to turn a Python script into an app with a little tweak and is also famous for data-related apps to interact with the data and visualize them. I think it can also be beneficial for people who want to see what their code can do and expand the idea based on a simple Python code.

### What you are watching in the video:
An interactive background remover web app using Python and Streamlit, Pillow for image processing, and 'rembg' for background removal. Users can:

- Upload images
- Resize them
- Customize background color
- Remove the background with a simple click
- Resize images with a simple click
- Can Filter Image Resizer Sampling
- Download the processed image as zip

The app also supports advanced options like alpha matting and allows easy downloads of the processed image.

### Libraries used:
- **Streamlit**: For creating a user-friendly web interface.
- **Pillow**: For image manipulation.
- **rembg**: For removing backgrounds from images.
